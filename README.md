GithubSpy offers a nice visual of statistics about your GitHub profile. It is built with Next.js and is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/ 'visit vercel').

## A few things about API calls
The statistics that appear on the dashboard are fetched from several APIs listed here. I will not be specifying the results from those APIs, they each have good documentation.

* **GitHub Contribution Calendar API**: [https://gh-calendar.rschristian.dev/user](https://gh-calendar.rschristian.dev/user 'visit website -->')
